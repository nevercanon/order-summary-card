### What I learned

I think the most significant concept I learned through this project was how to use box shadows. I had seen them before but never really used them, except for when following along with tutorials. I had to review how to use them and experiment a little to get the results that I wanted. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to solidify this information more strongly in my brain.

I'm not quite sure I did the background image positioning correctly. I got approximately the correct positioning when my screen was full-size, but changing the screen size in any way moved the background, which I suspect it wasn't supposed to. I need to figure out how to keep the position exactly where I want it at any screen size.

### Continued development

I plan on continuing with general CSS and HTML in my projects. I'd like to use box shadows more in future projects to get more confident with those. I also would like to learn more about responsive design and background positioning. I want my pages to move more smoothly as they transition from different screen sizes, and background positioning will be important in that as well.

### Useful resources
